This package provides a wrapper around the Intercom API in the form of a python client. It conforms to the OpenAPI specification files provided by Intercom.

This is an **unofficial** client and is in no way maintained by or directly affiliated to Intercom. 

This package was largely generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: {{appVersion}}
- Package version: {{packageVersion}}
{{#unless hideGenerationTimestamp}}
- Build date: {{generatedDate}}
{{/unless}}
- Build package: {{generatorClass}}

Modifications to the Handlebars templates used to generate the client can be found in the `./templates` folder. The custom convienence interface can be found in the `./intercom_python_api/client.py` module.

The package is kept up-to-date to the most recent API version. For older API versions, use the spec files provided in this repository or download a spec file from Intercom's repostiroy. You can regenerate the client with the following command:

`generate_api.sh $SPEC_FILE` 

Intercom's OpenAPI specification's do not adhere strictly to the specification and may require some modification to generate a proper client.

- query_params

- header_params
- cookie_params

### Endpoint Responses
All API calls / endpoint responses will a response object with three attributes:

- response: urllib3.HTTPResponse
